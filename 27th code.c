/*Mastermind is a British television game show. Its creator, Bill Wright, drew inspiration from his experiences of being
asked quiz questions during World War II. The show featured an intimidating setting and challenging quiz questions.
A quiz competition was held for students of Kingsway New Primary School in Manchester, Northwest during Spring. Julia,
 a seventh standard student, has won N number of books in the show. She bought all the books to class and kept them one
 above the other on her table as a single pile of books. She had books mixed up of different subjects. Julia picks book
 of particular subject and counts them. Also she determines total cost of all the books she won. Apply Problem Solving
 Framework and write a modular C program to help Julia.*/
